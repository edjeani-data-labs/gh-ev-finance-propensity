# 🇬🇭 EV Financing Propensity Model - Ghana 🚗⚡️

## 🌟 Project Overview

Welcome to the EV Financing Propensity Modeling project for Ghana! This initiative aims to leverage the rich insights from household socioeconomic data to identify individuals or households that are strong candidates for Electric Vehicle (EV) financing loans. As Ghana moves towards a greener future, understanding who is most likely to adopt EVs is crucial for financial institutions looking to support this transition.

This project is currently in its **initial phase**. We are setting up the foundations, exploring the data, and defining the methodologies to build a robust predictive model.

## 🎯 Project Goals

The primary goal is to develop a data-driven propensity model that can:

1. Identify Ghanaian households or individuals with a high likelihood of being interested in and qualifying for an EV financing loan.
2. Provide actionable insights for financial institutions to target their marketing efforts more effectively.
3. Support the growth of sustainable transportation in Ghana.
4. Explore and understand the socioeconomic factors that drive EV adoption potential in the Ghanaian context.

## 📊 Dataset

This project will primarily utilize the **Ghana Annual Household Income and Expenditure Survey (AHIES) 2023 dataset**. This comprehensive dataset, provided by the Ghana Statistical Service, offers detailed information on:

* Income and Employment
* Household Expenditures (including transportation)
* Demographics
* Location (Region, Urban/Rural)
* Assets and Housing Characteristics

A key challenge and an early task will be to **simulate a target variable** representing EV financing propensity, as this is not directly available in the survey data.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack (Planned)

We plan to use the following technologies:

* **Python:** For all data processing, analysis, and modeling.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model development and evaluation.
* **XGBoost / LightGBM:** For advanced gradient boosting models.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** For exploratory data analysis and iterative development.
* **SHAP:** For model interpretability.
* **Streamlit:** For building an interactive dashboard to showcase model insights (potential deployment).
* **Git & GitHub:** For version control and collaboration.

## ⏳ Current Status

* [x] Project idea defined and initial scope outlined.
* [x] Project structure created.
* [x] GitHub repository initialized.
* [ ] AHIES 2023 dataset acquisition (pending/in progress).
* [ ] Initial data loading and cleaning.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Acquire and Load Data:** Securely obtain the AHIES 2023 dataset and load it into our environment.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into the data to understand its characteristics, distributions, and potential predictors.
3. **Label Simulation Strategy:** Finalize and implement the strategy for creating the synthetic target variable for EV loan propensity.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features from the raw data.
5. **Baseline Model Development:** Build and evaluate initial predictive models.

## 🌱 How to Contribute (Placeholder)

*(This section can be expanded later if the project becomes collaborative.)*

For now, this project is primarily driven by its initial author. Future contributions might involve:

* Suggesting alternative modeling approaches.
* Improving feature engineering techniques.
* Enhancing the Streamlit dashboard.
